<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Tess Phillips and I am a second-year teacher based out of <em>Kansas City, Missouri.</em> I’ve always had a love for working with children. I enjoy helping them grow as learners and future contributing members to our society. While I may be a younger teacher, I bring to light conversations that surround inclusion and diversity in classroom environments. I grew up in rural Missouri and was not exposed to diversity until I went to college at the University of Missouri.<br/>My time in my undergraduate studies was dedicated to learning about what diversity means and how to value it in our society and classrooms. I fell in love with what it means to celebrate our differences and carried this with me to my professional life. Now, I currently serve as a diversity team member at my school and district level. Our focus is to help teach cultural competency in every classroom.</p>
