    Hello everyone! 
    My name is Tess Phillips and I am an elementary school teacher in Kansas City, Missouri. Iâ€™ve never had any formal web application or development training. I am excited to learn more about this! Throughout this course, I expect to learn the basics of coding. As stated, this is uncharted territory for me. I am open to learning anything new within this field. I want to use my web development skills eventually to help larger educational programs create websites that are engaging and work well for students. There are a number of resources that our district pushes teachers to use but they were not created with student engagement or accessibility in mind. My favorite hobby is reading. I enjoy all genres but my top three are mystery, fantasy and science fiction! Outside of that, in my free time, I like to spend time outside and binge watch all of my favorite shows.
