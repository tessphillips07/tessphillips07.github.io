    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Tess Phillips and I am a second-year teacher based out of Kansas City, Missouri. Iâ€™ve always had a love for working with children. I enjoy helping them grow as learners and future contributing members to our society. While I may be a younger teacher, I bring to light conversations that surround inclusion and diversity in classroom environments. I grew up in rural Missouri and was not exposed to diversity until I went to college at the University of Missouri. My time in my undergraduate studies was dedicated to learning about what diversity means and how to value it in our society and classrooms. I fell in love with what it means to celebrate our differences and carried this with me to my professional life. Now, I currently serve as a diversity team member at my school and district level. Our focus is to help teach cultural competency in every classroom.</p>
