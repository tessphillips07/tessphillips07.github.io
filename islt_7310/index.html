    <h4>Any inclusive classroom begins with knowing your students. Learn to build a welcoming environment where each student will feel loved and accepted for who they are.</h4>
    <p>As educators prepare to welcome students into their classrooms, it is important to keep in mind the value that each student brings to the space. Learn to develop an enriched community that celebrates student diversity. This involves curating a space where students feel represented, but can also learn more outside of their own culture. Cultivate a LGBTQ+ and gender-inclusive learning environment through language practice, classroom setup and school agreements. Practice strategies for better classroom management, parent involvement and teachable moments. This guide also offers resources for educators to learn and build cultural competency in young minds. Educators that adopt this way of teaching into their classroom work to reduce bullying behavior and establish a positive school climate. By applying these practices, youth build awareness but also foster support for people of color, LGBTQ+ communities and different socioeconomic status. At the conclusion of this guide, educators will reflect on the eight pathways for student success in the classroom.</p>
